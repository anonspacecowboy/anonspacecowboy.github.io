This is a study-project made to practice my nodejs-raw skills. In this project no framework was used, only standard node modules and a lite interface for geo-ip api.
Some web-dev technologies such as jquery were also used.

Pinger app can test the status of an address(online, offline or undefined), using either hostname and ip. In addition, using geo-ip api, this app can get the geo-localization of address(IP) for those that has an online or undefined status.
