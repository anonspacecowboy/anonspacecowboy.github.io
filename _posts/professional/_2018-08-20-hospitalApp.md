**The Project**
This WebApp was a request of a client with the main purpose of solving the time problem in medical appointments. In order to make an overall medical appointment faster, this app keep track of patient's history and provides a report to the doctor or nurse in charge of this patient.


**The Development**
This project was developed in nodejs/anguler due to to legacy projects of the same office. Even though nodejs/angular were the right fit for this project - __in my opinion__ - the results were pretty good.

The development of this project took a month and a week(37-38 days) plus another week to fix some bugs and layout/structural changes asked by the client.
