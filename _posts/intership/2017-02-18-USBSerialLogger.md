This project aims to perform wave measures near the coast, approximately 3 meters deep, using a small surface floater(picture below).

<br />

To execute this wave samples the inercial we've used the sensor xSensMti and a ARM-Raspberry pi(save these samples on SD and perform data processing).

<br />
**What I did in this project?**<br />
In this project I worked on a serial interface to get and log equipament's samples, and on a convertion script to make raw data readable.

* **Software/languages**: C(serial reader) and nodejs(script);
* **Hardware**: Raspberry pi and xSens Mti sensor;
* **Github project link**: [Github link](https://github.com/aracytopterm/USBSerial-logger)
* **Status**: Under development;
