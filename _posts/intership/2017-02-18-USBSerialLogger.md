The overall project consist in a autonomous small float that performs samples related to the equipament's motion and log these samples data in a file.

A script to convert raw samples is also included to the project.

In this project I worked on a serial interface to get and log equipament's samples, and on a convertion script to make raw sample data readable.

* **Software/languages**: C(serial reader) and nodejs(script)
* **Hardware**: Raspberry pi and xSens Mti sensor
* [Github link](https://github.com/aracytopterm/USBSerial-logger)
* **Status**: Under development
