In a Instrumention laboratory(LIOc- Laboratorio de instrumenta√ßao oceanografica, in this case) the development of driver for sampling information is recurrent, and for times we get our developers(including me) almost developing the same piece of code again and again.<br />
So, to solve this problem a library containing simple functions of I/O and other usefull stuffs like timestamps, timer thread and general file manipulations would be an excellent idea.
</div>

<div class="text">
And focusing in these problems that this project was designed. In a nutshell this project intends to create a pattern for these driver development and, consequently, gain a lot of time in development<br />
</div>

<div class="note">
It's important to note that this library is implemented in C and using some kernel function calls(debian) so this may not work in other OS.

    <b><u>What this library has?</u></b>
    <br />
    <ul>
        <li><u>File operations:</u> write bytes in a file, create folders and check if a folder exists.</li>
        <li><u>Communication protocols:</u> serial read/write functions, GPIO read/write functions and I2C read/write function.</li>
        <li><u>Timer thread:</u> realiable timer.</li>
        <li><u>Timestamp:</u> time stamp with miliseconds precision.</li>
    </ul>
</div>

<div class="text">
    <b><u>Documentation</u></b>
    Github links, pdf links, chart links, applied projects
</div>

<div class="note">
Any doubt or question about this project just send me an email. It's on contact page.
